Its been some time that I've bought an Arduino, and, having tried various sample projects in the Arduino Starter book,
I've goot bored quickly and decided to build something more interesting.

The idea I've come with is barely an "idea" - this isn't something new, I guess, but I'm trying to bring some spice.
The only issue with it, is that it involves a lot of work and in the areas I have little to no experience with, but
I'll get there - step-by-step.

So, the final goal, is to build a kind of a "virtual presence robot". A robot can be dispatched anywhere where internet
connection exists (wi-fi or 3g/4g) and one can connect to it over the internet. As a user, an operator, one controls a
robot from a web site: can move it around, get video and audio transmission in real-time, as well as, probably, few
other metrics from the environment the robot is dispatched into. On the other hand, operator's web cam captures
operators image and voice and transmits it to the robot's screen and speakers, effectively enabling the operator to
communicate with people around the robot and vice versa.

I know there are similar commercial products out there, and, most likely, some enthusiasts doing or having done same or
similarly already, but that's not the point. The point is - DIY. And, I'm looking forward to learning a lot of new
things on the way.

Oh boy this isn't an Arduino project anymore... And I need a name for it...
