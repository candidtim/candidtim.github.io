Once decided to build a "virtual presence robot" (I'll call it "VIPER" for the moment, until I've figured out a better
name), I'm starting to think of different possible ways to build it and trying out some of them.

I understand there is a lot to do, there are many ways to do it, and there are certainly so many things I probably miss
from the picture and don't consider now, so clearly I need to break it into pieces to tackle with it.

Word apart, I'm a software engineer and a project manager, and I practice Agile software development. I think this
project is a very good example of an Agile project. First, indeed I only have a global vision of it and not even sure I
will want to come with the solution I had in mind when starting. Second, I have no idea about details and how to come
with the solution, only few outlines for now. This is indeed something to do in an iterative manner. On the other hand,
it will be also largely a research project.

So for the moment, I think I would need to:

1. Build a proof-of-concept (POC) simple robot controlled over the internet
2. Build a POC to transmit video and audio streams from a robot to a web page, and vice versa.
3. Assemble it into a final solution.

Sounds too simple to be true. That's probably because I don't know what I don't know. Yet.
