I'm a software developer with 10 years of experince in large-scale enterprise applications development and technical
management; Sun Certified Java Developer, Scrum Alliance Certified Scrum Master, Python enthusiast and Scala novice.
In this irregularly updated blog I keep notes of some of my findings, if I consider they might be useful for someone else.

Feel free to contact me by email if you would like to. If you like this blog and we can share thoughts, and by any
chance you live in Paris - I would be glad to see you on some BBL, conference or just at lunch - feel free to send me
an email. And, while not actively searching, yet I'm open to job offers.
