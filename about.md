I work in software development industry for almost 20 years now and have
experience in various B2B domains ranging from enterprise integration
software to FinTech and PropTech, in both large multinational and start-up
environments. In this irregularly updated blog I keep notes of some of my
findings, when I think they might be useful for someone else.

Feel free to contact me by email at `<my first name @ my family name . com >`.
If you like this blog and we can share thoughts, and by any chance you live in
Paris - I would be glad to see you on some BBL, conference or just at lunch.
