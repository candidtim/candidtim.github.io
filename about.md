I'm a software developer with 10 years of experince in large-scale enterprise applications development and technical
management; Sun Certified Java Developer, Scrum Alliance Certified Scrum Master, Python enthusiast and Scala novice.
Here, in this blog, you will find my personal experience on various development technologies and approaches I want to
share. Because, you know, sharing is good.

Feel free to contact me by email if you would like to. If you like this blog and we can share thoughts, and by any
chance you live in Paris - I would be glad to see you on some BBL, conference or just at lunch - feel free to send me
an email. And, while not actively searching, yet I'm open to job offers.
